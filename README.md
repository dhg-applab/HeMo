# TUM HeMo - Healthy Mobility


More than half of the European population does not reach the 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week that is recommended by the World Health Organization.
Traditional apps in wearables and smartphones tackle this problem with different behavior change techniques (BCT).
The Apple Watch's Activity app, for example, sends prompts to stand up and move for one minute after one hour of sitting.
Although BCT like this can have a positive impact on individuals' physical activity, such activity interventions are delivered at timepoints not considering the current users' context and engagement which cloud lower the users' participation.
The HeMo app faces this issue by integrating more seamlessly in the user's everyday life.
The HeMo app aims to increase physical activity in everyday travel and changes the user's daily commute habits.
It recommends healthy routes based on different constraints the user can set such as the preferred transportation modes (Walking, Cycling, Public Transport, Car) and distance constraints.
